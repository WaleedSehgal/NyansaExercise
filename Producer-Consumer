##Bug Identification:
In the consumer code we need to put a WHILE instead of an IF while waiting.
Because lets say if some other consumer B wakes up before the consumer A and accesses the item.
The queue will get empty again. And then if consumer A wakes up, the queue will be empty and upon trying 
to remove the item from the queue an exception will be thrown.

#below is the pseudo code with the FIX:

#Producer
while (true) {
       item = generate_item()
       mutex.lock()
       fifo_queue.push(item)
       mutex.unlock()
       condition.signal()
}

#Consumers
while(true) {
       mutex.lock()
       while (fifo_queue.empty()) {  #FIX
             condition.wait(mutex)
       }
       item = fifo_queue.remove()
       mutex.unlock()
       process_item(item)
}
